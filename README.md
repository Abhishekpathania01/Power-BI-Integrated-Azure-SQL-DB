## Cognitive Services

Effective cognitive computing requires easy-to-use service endpoints
consumable by apps with images, audio, and other media and data that
needs to be processed by sophisticated cognitive systems that return
straightforward and usable results. Let your students get their hands on
cognitive algorithms quickly using Microsoft’s Cognitive Services APIs.
There are many entry points into the exploration of cognitive computing.

### Image Processing


This lab will take you through setting up the lab and verifying access.

**Prerequisites**

*	Windows or a Mac machine with HTML5 supported browser such as Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Chrome or Firefox. <br/>
*	On a Mac, if you haven’t set up Remote Desktop, please see this reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-mac
*	You should have registered in the training portal https://experienceazurecloud-qa.azurewebsites.net/#/odl/Power-BI-Conference-Lab/7c5bfb07-be19-4024-8278-ea25b2eafe64. After registration, you’d have received an email link below. Click on Launch Lab to start the deployment. You should start the deployment only when you’re ready to execute exercise since this lab will auto- destroy after 2 hours.
